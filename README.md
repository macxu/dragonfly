## Synopsis

Dragonfly is a light-weight tool for testing management and reporting

## Features
 - Parse source code for test automation cases managed by Maven, and report the results like what cases are being designed,
   the details of them, which of them are automated, by which test class and test method etc.

 - Scrape Jenkins, and report the results like what jobs are grouped by a view, their builds, the test cases executed by each build,
   the execution result of each build and test case, by which test class and which test method etc.

 - Connect the source code and Jenkins, report the results from a high-level perspective so we know what test cases are being executed by which job and its
   execution history.

 - Analyze the source code, report which projects are following data-driven approach and which are not yet.

 - Analyze the source code, report what cases are designed without being executed.
